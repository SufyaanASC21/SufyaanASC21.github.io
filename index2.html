    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <p>This is a game that I would play being small. Since I learned JavaScipt, I wanted to create a game so I decided to make this game.
        Although this game is not completed and is still in progress, I feel like I put a lot of effort into it and wanted to showcase it.
